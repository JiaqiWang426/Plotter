# Plotter summary
Main Function: Read the data copied in the clipboard, sort them, calculate cumulation probabiltiy and z value of each data point and plot them.

Instruction: copy column(s) of data from csv file, input the number of places you want the data to be rounded to, click "plot cumulation distribution" or "click z value" to plot. Click the title, axes and legends to edit them. Hover your mouse on the data point to see annotations of the sample points. Use indigenous functions of Matplotlib (saving figure, magnifying, etc). Select "plot on the previous figure" so that your next plot can be remained on the same figue (cum_distribution figures will not be mixed with z-value figures). 

Other details: English and Simplified Chinese are supported. The ticks of y-axis for cum_distribution figures are fixed, with the bottom probabilities (0% - 1%) and the top probabilities (99% - 100%) amplified. The ticks of x-axis for both figures are diversion points for 10 equal diversion parts based on the maximum value and 0 as the minimum value.
